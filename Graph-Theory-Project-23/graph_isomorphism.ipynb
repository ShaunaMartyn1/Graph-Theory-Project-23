    "# Graph Isomorphism Problem\n",
    "***\n",
    "The graph isomorphism problem is the computational problem of determining whether two finite graphs are isomorphic.\n",
    "It asks whether there exists a bijection between the vertices of the two graphs that preserve edges, so that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the edges of the first graph and those of the second. The problem is considered to be computationally difficult and is not known to be solvable in polynomial time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Graph isomorphism problem is a question of determining whether two graphs are equivalent, meaning they have the same structure rather than a specific algorithm to be executed. \n",
    "There are many algorithms and methods that have been developed to solve the Graph isomorphism problem ranging from mathematical and theoretical approaches to practical computational methods. These include backtracking, canonical labelling, group theory, neural networks, and randomised algorithms. \n",
    "Backtracking is a general algorithmic technique that considers searching every possible combination to solve a computational problem. It can find all or some solutions to the problem by trying out a potential candidate and backtracking as soon as it is found that the candidate will not work as a valid solution. A real-life example of backtracking would be the game sudoku. The player tried out a number and if it does not work, they backtrack and try another number. Backtracking can be seen as a type of depth-first search. \n",
    "Backtracking is a form of recursion; recursion is a function that can call itself. \n",
    "There are 3 types of problems in backtracking, Decision problem, Optimization problem and Enumeration problem. In Decision problem we search for a feasible solution, Optimization problem we search for the best solution and Enumeration problem we find all feasible solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Isomorphic graphs may have the same structure, but the vertex labels may be different. \n",
    "In both cases there are four vertices and four edges. The vertices in the first graph are labelled 1,2,3 and 4 while the vertices in the second graph are labelled A, B, C and D. Despite the labels the graphs have the same structure. Vertices 1 and A are adjacent to vertices 2 and B, vertices 2 and B are adjacent to vertices 3 and C and vertices 3 and C are adjacent to vertices 4 and D. By examining the graphs, it is safe to say they are isomorphic. \n",

    "### Canonical Labelling\n",
    "Canonical labelling also known as canonical form, is a graph which is isomorphic which represents the isomorphism class of (Piperno 2011). The complexity class of canonical labelling is not known. \n",
    "\n",
    "A standard method for handling the graph isomorphism issue is to map each graph to a specific string representation called a code or canonical label. A canonical label has a property that if two graphs are isomorphic their codes should be equal. By using this property testing for graph isomorphism is possible by analysing the canonical labels of the two graphs. The first part of creating a canonical label of a graph is to find an adjacency matrix for the graph. The second step is to decide on the string description for each adjacency matrix. The adjacency matrix is symmetric it is best to produce the string description depending on the upper triangular part of the matrix. The code is acquired by linking the entries of the upper triangular matric in a column-wise fashion. The final step is to correlate all the string descriptions of the graph and select the one that has the lowest or highest value.\n",

    "### Randomised Algorithms\n",
    "Randomised algorithms have been studied for the graph isomorphism problem and they have successfully provided solutions for some types of graphs. One of the most famous randomised algorithms for graph isomorphism is the Las Vegas algorithm by Laszlo Babai which was published in 2015.\n",
    "The Las Vegas algorithm uses “canonical Labelling” to check if two graphs are equal. This is done by comparing the two graphs canonical forms that are determined by their connectivity structure and then comparing them again to see if they are isomorphic. The algorithm works by using randomisation to generate the canonical forms. The algorithms then run in polynomial time with a high probability. This algorithm does not guarantee correctness however, the error probability can be made much smaller by repeating the algorithm several times. Although the Las Vegas algorithm represents a significant breakthrough in the study of graph isomorphism it is still relatively new and further research and is needed to fully understand its performance and limitations.  \n"

    "In conclusion, graph isomorphism is an interesting and important concept in graph theory. It is an essential problem that has been studied for decades and although it is not complete there has been siginficant progress in developing algorithms for solving it. Graph isomorphism is relevant in other areas of computer science such as social network analysis, cryptography and network analysis. The development of efficient algorithms for solving graph isomorphism has the potential to revolutionise these fields by providing a powerful tool for analysing and interpreting large datasets. Overall graph isomorphism is a captavating topic with far reaching implications and will continue to be an attractive subject to research in years to come. "
